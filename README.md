# Instructions to develop a Help Desk ticketing system prototype:

#1. Define the Ticket class with common ticket information such as ticket number, ticket creator name, staff ID, contact email, description of the issue, response, and ticket status (open, closed, reopened).
#2. Create a method in the Ticket class for submitting tickets, requiring all necessary information mentioned in the client requirements.
#3. Implement a method in the Ticket class for responding to tickets, handling password change requests as per the specified rule and providing an option for the IT department to respond and update the ticket status.
#4. Include a method in the Ticket class for resolving password change requests, generating a new password, updating the response, and closing the ticket.
5. Create a method in the Ticket class for maintaining ticket statistics, including the number of tickets created, resolved, and open. This method should be able to return the statistics information.
6. Develop the main class containing the Main method where instances of tickets are created, resolved, reopened, responded to, and displayed.
7. Display ticket statistics after tickets are created, resolved, reopened, and responded to.
8. Ensure the output format for displaying ticket information matches the example provided in the scenario, including ticket number, ticket creator, staff ID, email address, description of the issue, response, and ticket status.
9. Test the functionality of the Help Desk ticketing system prototype by creating tickets, resolving some, reopening others, responding to tickets, and displaying ticket information and statistics as per the requirements.
10. Make necessary adjustments and improvements based on testing feedback to ensure the prototype meets all client requirements effectively.
